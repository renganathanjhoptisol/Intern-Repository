## Understanding ios EcoSystem

# What is Xcode ?

	The Xcode IDE is at the center of the Apple development experience. Tightly
intergrated with the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, Xcode is an incredibly productive
environment for building apps for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Apple Tv.

# Some smoothness of Xcode

	Because everything is so well integrated, workflows feel natural. As you compose
a new interface, the Assistant editor intuitively presents the related source code in a
split window pane. Simply drag the mouse to connect UI controls to the implementation code.
Apple LLVM compiler technologies parse your code, keeping every symbol you see in the LLDB
debugger consistent with the editor and compiler. As you type, that same engine is constantly 
at work, finding mistakes and offering Fix-its for your code.

	Xcode even communicates with the Apple developer website, so you can enable services
such as Game Center or Passbook in your app with single click. When your app is ready, Xcode will 
bundle and submit your app to the App Store.

## Note : Xcode only runs on macOs, which means you need a Mac if you want to build
	  ios apps with Xcode. Xcode won't run on iPad. A few alternatives for Windows/Pc
	  are available, but they are far from ideal

## Minimum system requirements for Xcode 12:

	1. A Mac with macOs 11 
	2. 4 GB RAM, but 8+GB is more comfortable
	3. At least 8 GB of free storage space or more

	from the Mac App Store – via the Terminal command line!
